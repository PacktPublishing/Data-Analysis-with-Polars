Halo is a sci-fi shooting match that lets you experience first-hand a mysterious alien ring-world. Loaded with combat, Halo will have you fighting on foot, in vehicles, inside and outdoors with Alien and Human weaponry. Your objective is to uncover Halo's horrible secrets and destroy mankind's sworn enemy, the Covenant. Fight the Covenant in dozens of missions as you discover the virulent secrets of Halo. Your many goals include attacking enemy outposts, raiding underground labs for advanced technology, rescuing fallen comrades, stealing alien vehicles and weaponry and sniping at enemy forces.","This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent of <i>Tribes</i>) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier,  la <i>Aliens</i>. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.","It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way through <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style."],"also_buy":["B00008J7NZ","B00006IR20","B000FRU0NU","B00005RHQT","B001E36YWU","B0002A2S26","B015N6R8XC","B0001DI6FM","B001ELWMHI","B000067DPM","B001HWB68K","B000930DA0","B01M0XPWJO","B07D19QQHW","B00006409Z","B00006LELH","B002BSA20M","B0009O7HUI","B0050SYY5E","B0002ILSH4","B00005NZ1I","B0001UEHP8","B07DVTNQP8","B0002B90SA","B00006JZQZ","B07B38YC3P","B000B2YR74","B000FRS9II","B00097IA88","B00008NA6E","B000HVDEQO","B014FJTIFE","B0001ADAMO","B00005RCQ5","B00005NZ1K","B00005U8TR","B00005BZCH","B000088KH3","B0001I9YE4","B0009Z3HZQ","B000E61G4O","B00006IJJK","B0009351RK","B00150UUSQ","B00006JC3S","B0062E3YU6","B0006SST9U","B0001KUE7S","B0000A082T","B0006ZJPSC","B0006BK5AI","B00019AZAK","B00020BV1A","B00005R6YX","B00FKV8AK6","B00005OWBL","B0007ZD79E","B00BQMGW4Y","B0002VYPEE","B0000C7GH4","B0002IJY2U","B01L1K0S9U","B0000A1OG8","B0002SQ0BS","B0009350C6","B0009UC68U","B002I0H79C","B000K8YAKI","B00008XKZM","B000095ZGZ","B0000C6EDM","B00006C28W","B000AX21VI","B00008G75X","B000F2JUOK","B07D2FT283","B00008H2IU","B004AGYHUE","B0000DJX7I","B07B4VHT83","B0002CHJ2S","B0000C4M23","B076J9TNCD","B079ZPCCLM","B00008G764","B000ZK9QD2","B000G82DDS","B00006LU9L","B00008KTNW","B00AOLU3GQ","B00006LEMQ","B003XRLI1M","B0016CQ0Q4","B0002XL3BA","B0008GJRQ4","B00020BV0Q","B00006IJIW","B00012TIW8","B0009UUQG4"],"also_view":["B0050SYY5E","B000FRU0NU","B00008J7NZ","B00006IR20","B001MLBJY2","B001ELWMHI","B00005RHQT","B0002A2S26","B07B38YC3P","B00KSQHX1K","B000BDHBBW","B001E36YWU","B002BSA20M","B006HPLKK6","B00FKV8AK6","B002B5FQC4","B015N6R8XC","B000K8ZTK8","B001HWB68K","B000067DPM","B00006JZQZ","B013GZ67Y8","B0050SYX8W","B0009O7HUI","B00006409Z","B01M0XPWJO","B0001DI6FM","B01GW914HU","B00097IA88","B07D2FT283","B07DPHHLV3","B00D781W3Q","B00DB9JV5W","B07D19QQHW","B002MD02YM","B000FRS9II","B000K8YAKI","B0007ZD79E","B01L1K0S9U","B0034JKYO6","B0050SYEYK","B0006SST9U","B000HVDEQO","B001F6KSDM","B00006LELH","B000V761SM","B000NV8F58","B000930DA0","B00020BV1A","B00005RKO7","B07DVTNQP8","B00005BZCH","B0006BK5AI","B000FDMV9U","B0009UC68U","B003IT6E8C","B002I0HCVK"],"feature":["Control a character during massive firefights as you eliminate as many Covenant soldiers as possible","Engage in guerilla warfare against the enemy, using whatever is at your disposal on the station","Use your tactics skills to command squads and eliminate the enemy","Role-based team &amp; multiplayer combat with over 25 characters onscreen at a time","A wide variety of vehicles &amp; locations designed in perfect detail"]}

Lush visual elements enhance gameplay in this phenomenal action game.","<i>Final Fantasy X</i> is the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.","Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal."],"also_buy":["B00008URUA","B000F5IH2I","B000066TS5","B0009A4EVM","B00004Y57G","0744001404","B000B69E9G","B0000296O5","B00000JRSB","B01L1P49OA","B00002R28C","B0792PXC9T","B0000C7GHG","B0002XL3BA","B000G6SPHI","B000FDOTIQ","B00005O0I2","B07KPQ2BWQ","B00004TN9O","B001G3B0HC","B0015DOL8I","B0009I6S0O","B0000A0MDV","B0000690ZE","B00004SQPD","B00005R5PO","B0045L3SNQ","B0000696CZ","B0001VGFK2","B00004TC6E","B0002Y2XXQ","B00005NCCR","B01AILTT1G","B0002RQ3ES","B0009O7HVM","B00004YRQ9","B01LY4QRT8","B00005LOXE","B000KCX9M4","B001C6GVI6","B00006GSNX","B000GPVUQ2","B000LOAQNQ","B0009A4EV2","B0009XBWY6","B07DHTN9LQ","B00008RUYZ","B00004ZDFY","B00020LZAM","B00009ZVHY","B074X3HWLY","0744008379","B0000503MO","B018JYN9ME","B000935256","B00024W1U6","B0797XG859","B076P3LT93","B00005ML10","B0014CN2H6","B00019AZBO","B000099T1Y","B00008H2IW","B0000A082Y","B00004S9AF","B0001NE48U","B000E49SGE","B0009SQF0C","B0015ACX3Q","B0002EJ8FC","B00JA81WQE","B000TYQL1O","B00020LZBG","B00005J536","B00004YRQA","B07CTH99V4","B00009VE6D","B077RYCNM6","B000HTWX22","B00C3MKCF6","B00005ME6O","B00009WAVI","B00005NN5G","B00005Q8IR","0744001986","0744002850","B0009EHQVI","B000099T2H","B01LZA64X7","B000EHQDA0","B00008KTRS","B00005BW7Q","B07413XT5W","B000069BD9","B000FQ2DTA","B002WXGP6Q","B01DX7S4KE","B0002CHJ8C"],"also_view":["B000066TS5","B000F5IH2I","B00008URUA","B00QU47SJG","B0009A4EVM","B000FDOTIQ","B00004Y57G","B00000JRSB","B000B69E9G","B000G6SPHI","B0009I6S0O","B00002R28C","B0002Y2XXQ","B0009XBWY6","B00008RUYZ","B000KCX9M4","B001C6GVI6","B0002XL3BA","B0000696CZ","B01L1P49OA","B001G3B0HC","B0000296O5","B0002B90OE","B0009O7HVM","B00GCB2Z0E","B000FQ2DTA","B0000A0MDV","B00C3MKCF6","B00005NCCR","B00005ML10","B0001VGFK2","B0002RQ3ES","B0009SQF0C","B0009A4EV2","B00004YRQ9","B00004TN8R","B00005R5PO","B0000C7GHG","B0000690ZE","B00005LOXE","B07KPQ2BWQ","B0014CN2H6","B0009UUQGE","B00J007N0Q","B00HD4R5RW","B000A32O4W","0744001404","B000GPVUQ2","B07HCT37HS","B000LOAQNQ","B0045L3SNQ","B0792PXC9T","B00020LZAM","B00024W1TW","B0797XG859","B0001ADAME","B00019HNNC","B0009F3E1I","B00006F2ZP","B000099T1Y"],"feature":["Learn to summon aeons-old spirits of power to add to your fighting abilities as you battle the evils of Sin","Tidus is a star athlete who survives a massive disaster, and with the help of a girl named Yuna, he journeys to temples &amp; monasteries to find truth.","Tidus is a star athlete who survives a massive disaster, and with the help of a girl named Yuna, he journeys to temples &amp; monasteries to find truth.","Learn to summon aeons-old spirits of power to add to your fighting abilities as you battle the evils of Sin","Spectacular graphics and incredible voiceover work will immerse you in a new world where evil forces threaten the existence of all you know!"]}

New Action - Grab a Mega Mushroom and grow to incredible proportions, or smash through your foes in a blue Koopa shell. 2 Distinct Multiplayer Modes - New Super Mario Bros. features competitive 2-player multiplayer and mini-game functionality supporting up to 4 players. A Classic Storyline - Bowser and Bowser Jr. have kidnapped Princess Peach, again, and only Mario and you can save her. Powerups Galore - You'll find classic power-ups, like the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower in the game, as well as some all-new ones that let Mario explore the Mushroom Kingdom like never before. New Moves - New Super Mario Bros. expands Mario's arsenal of moves to include some very powerful advanced techniques. If you want to uncover every secret in the game, you'll have to master them all.","","","<b>Gameplay</b><br /> Although <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> is a modern addition to the <i>Mario Bros.</i> tome, it revels in the fact that it is an old school side-scrolling platformer through and through. The single player mode is set on 80 levels spread across eight worlds, with players assuming the role of either Mario or Luigi. As in all <i>Mario Bros.</i> games, the ultimate goal is to rescue Peach, but as players traverse game levels the immediate goal is to collect coins, hop on top of enemies, and break open blocks while searching for power-ups as you race to capture the flag at the end of each level. Each of the game's eight worlds climaxes with a boss battle tied into the abduction of Peach, in which players will need to utilize the game's six power-ups in order to have success.","Along with its single player mode <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> for DS also features two different multiplayer modes. The first is the Mario vs. Luigi, 2-player competitive mode. Here it's brother vs. brother in a literal race for Stars. Players choose to play as either Mario or Luigi, with the goal to collect the Stars that appear throughout the stage at timed intervals. If one brother gets a star(s) first they can be stolen away by the other player by doing damage. The one who gets to the set number of stars wins. This mode uses local wireless DS Single-Card download play, so only one game card is needed. The other multiplayer mode revolves around mini-game play.

But Liquid Ocelot is not the only one who will be able to manipulate the world's wars--Snake can destabilize opposing forces by working behind the scenes, supporting the local militia as they fight PMCs, creating a smokescreen that allows Snake to move freely within the war-zone.","MGS4 is a next-generation adventure set in the aftermath of <a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008DWT5/${0}\"><i>MGS2: Sons of Liberty</i></a>. The concept behind the latest <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> project is \"no place to hide,\" and this edition in the series will force Snake into unexpected circumstances with an all-new storyline that breaks away in some ways from the previous <i>MGS</i> franchise entries. We don't want to spoil it for you, but, producer Hideo Kojima did reveal some very juicy tidbits about the game and the storyline when it was first announced at E3 of 2006. \"Until now,\" said Kojima, \"we've released two entries of the <i>MSX2 Metal Gear</i> series, and three entries in the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> series. Add to this <i>Portable Ops</i>, and you get a total of six titles. All mysteries will be cleared up in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>.\"","Kojima was very clear about the finality of <i>MSG4</i>, leaving gamers to wonder, \"Will Snake die?!\" When asked if the story will come to this sort of an end, Kojima responded without the slightest bit of vagueness, \"It will come to an end.\" The <i>MGS4</i> E3 trailer showed a number of characters from the <i>Metal Gear</i> and <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> histories. This final installment is sure to deliver loads of cameos, in fact, it is rumored that nearly all the characters from the series will make an appearance.","In addition to a return of classic <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> characters, the gameplay systems from part three are also expected to make a comeback. The camouflage system from part three will make it into <i>MGS4</i>, with the addition of \"OctoCamo,\" Snake's most advanced stealth suit to date. The name appears to be formed from the words \"Octopus\" and \"camoflauge,\" and players will be awestruck by the chameleon-like camo that changes with the surroundings. OctoCamo allows Snake to blend in with his environment as it digitally manifests nearby textures in real time. Think if it this way, if Snake is standing next to a wall worn out with holes, he too will appear to be riddled with holes. It has also been revealed that <i>MGS4</i> will have online play, but no specifics have been released. Although very little information is known about the game's visuals, rumor has it that <i>MGS4</i> is expected to be the finest representation of console graphics on the PS3, and it is expected that they will just get better and better as the game nears its release date.<p/><p/>"],"also_buy":["B0050SX97I","B002I0J8FI","B00JKM06EO","B002AB7TX8","B00GJSUUC0","B007CM0K86","B00CTKHXFO","B000ZK7ZOE","B007IFMEYK","B002I0GX88","B00KTZELMY","B00001X50M","B0002RQ3ES","B003O6E67A","B00309XHD0","B000ZK9QCS","B0050SYOOA","B008CP6Q6M","B001SGZL2W","B0055202HE","B005VBVQDI","B007A7UJ4S","B000FQBF1M","B008CP6RWU","B000FQ2DTA","B00275A7LI","B005YR308S","0761559698","B005N4HBIW","B002BRZ8FW","B000X1TC0U","B002BRYIJY","B003O6EDSM","B002I0J5FG","B0050SXAIG","B002I0J4VQ","B00CPKUV98","B003VUO6H4","B0012N3T3Y","B000BXKA38","B009DL2TBA","B002I0F5I2","B000JLIXIG","B000TVT7U4","B00JKM06HG","B002I0K6DG","B00AEX81SG","B0050SX7BQ","B007SRM5U6","B008PQU3E4","B000UC5ML0","B0050SWUTQ","B002I0H2G0","B00HD4R5YU","B008CP6RUW","B0028A6UUY","B003C1I06U","B07D2X8QHM","B002I0J82G","B002BS47TE","B0050SXX88","B002I0F5M8","B000R39GPA","B0000A09EN","B002I0J5UQ","B000MUW98O","B0016B28WU","B0022TNO7I","B0012N94WO","B01GKHJP4I","B002NN7AKU","B001B1W3GG","B00DJ42BUQ","B002BRYHY0","B001NX6GBK","B002ELCV00","B00C7103DO","B002I0J5YW","B002BRZ6UE","B003O680RM","B003O6JIVE","B00005ML10","B000K9OP2A","B002BXKJ6O","B005T5OBWY","B003O6E6NE","B0050SXU3Q","B004NRN5EO","B006ZTHFPS","B00CRL9TU2","B000FII8KQ","B0085CA8QG","B00006IJJK","B000ZK7ZMQ","B000HKP88C","B006IOAHPK","B01NBHB1N9","B007FQUEZ8","B002BSC4ZS","B000P297EI"],"also_view":["B00CTKHXFO","B00KTZELMY","B0050SX97I","B00JKM06EO","B001IVPVVS","B002I0J8FI","B07D2X8QHM","B0050SYOOA","B001B3UOR4","B002AB7TX8","B0050SXAIG","B00JKM06HG","B003O6E67A","B007CM0K86","B00001X50M","B000E6DYXA","B0055202HE","B008CP6MA2","B00309XHD0","B000HKP88C","B0002RQ3ES","B00005ML10","B0050SXVK8","B008CP6RWU","B001SGZL2W","B0050SXI6K","B0050SX7BQ","B002BRYIJY","B00B2UHN66","B002BRZ8FW","B002NN7AKU","B000JLIXIG","B01NBHB1N9","B005YR308S","B002I0J5JW","B00GJSUUC0","B002I0GX88","B000ZK9QCS","B003O6EDSM","B003VUO6H4","B0050SXKU4","B008CP6Q6M","B003C1I06U","B00UFOYR2I","B001JKTC9A","B000K9OP2A","B00503E9FY","B0014WJ78E","B000UW21A0","B076QSS8XX","B002I0F5I2","B000ZK7ZOE","B005N4HBIW","B01IPDIKJG","B008CP6RUW","B00CPKUV98","B00CJ7IUI6","B004P7VGF2","B000JLIYLC","B007A7UJ4S"],"feature":["Although little is known, MGS4 is being touted as the final installment in the Metal Gear Solid series.","Chameleon-like camouflage system, Octacamo, blends Snake into his surroundings.","Loads of characters from previous Metal Gear Solid installments will return in this final chapter.","Slated for simultaneous worldwide release in June 2008, Konami has released very few details about MGS4.","Built for the PS3, the game is expected to be the finest representation of the console's graphics"]}

As they slip into debt and get dragged into a criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city that worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don't."],"also_buy":["B0050SYILE","B00A7QPNK4","B00Z0DOXEQ","B002DC8GMM","B002I0HBZW","B00YX0Z40Y","B0062KIC2A","B0045EI7I4","B0050SYV70","B008B3AVNE","B005N4HBE6","B001SH7YMG","B0050SWTAQ","B00EFFW0HC","B003KM38EK","B00MU1YENG","B00503E8S2","B000P46NMK","B002I098JE","B006ZTHGCK","B0050SY5BM","B00EVWZHLK","B002BSA20M","B004X56OU8","B00YOJ13GS","B000WPXQSQ","B06XJH279C","B008HHTEXW","B002MED6F8","B000FRS9II","B003R783IY","B00269QLI8","B01GD4923C","B003O6E986","B000ZKDOV2","B07BJKZ7ZS","B00MAPYKPO","B00AOLU3GQ","B007SRM5MO","B00EPIHAQK","B006IOAHTQ","B0017ZDGWG","B002I0K50U","B00KME8KFG","B008LW4SBQ","B00V84Q1QE","B003C1I0CO","B005YR1VP2","B000F3AADE","B000WEQL02","B00M9TD70K","B00KSR3B6U","B00BMFIXT2","B0000DJX7I","B00M7ZJ2LY","B078ZHFXCH","B00KVSQAGO","B001G3AZS2","B000FRU0NU","B073VY4P31","B004CVQUGQ","B002E1SBVI","B002I0JGDM","B00DUV027M","B01NCE21EA","B0034JKYO6","B00AXB7ED2","B004HYK956","B00D9EPI38","B005FDUSTA","B00BS5ER8M","B00CKKIJ24","B001YI0Z2U","B002BRZ852","B004P6IVPQ","B00005NZ1G","B003JVKHEQ","B073WJCQGT","B00GFRK8Z4","B003O6G5TW","B00L9OPNW6","B000AX21VI","B01KBL4ISW","B00OEA4ADU","B00M7ZIZGC","B00DYQ7DN4","B000B6MLV4","B00SXEOOHU","B000RI17FM","B0022TNO7S","B00CJ7IUGS","B01GW8XLCM","B00354NAYG","B00DWXV1DM","B002BRYHUY","B0050SYLRK","B00FRESY6G","B0092ZEILQ"],"also_view":["B0050SYILE","B00A7QPNK4","B0062KIC2A","B0045EI7I4","B00Z0DOXEQ","B078PQ9PWK","B002DC8GMM","B00CY92XUA","B003R783IY","B00KAED6RU","B005N4HBE6","B002I098JE","B000FNDYWI","B002MED6F8","B00YX0Z40Y","B00KVSQAGO","B0050SWTAQ","B0050SYV70","B0022TNO7S","B01LKEWXPE","B00GSR4T74","B002I0K50U","B01NCE21EA","B00EFFW0HC","B006ZTHGCK","B008B3AVNE","B001SH7YMG","B00BMFIXT2","B000WPXQSQ","B0045U01OG","B002I0HBZW","B000ZK698C","B007SRM5MO","B000KCX9M4","B00AXB7ED2","B000TG530M","B00BGD6LMG","B003KM38EK","B003O6G5TW","B00EVWZHLK","B00MU1YENG","B0013RATNM","B009KG9I44","B001AWIP68","B003O6N266","B00503E8S2","B0001VGFK2","B002BRZ852","B0050SXKU4","B001JFTDLM","B01GD4923C","B000FRU0NU","B00KL3W626","B008LW4SBQ","B00DC9SWWE"],"feature":["Carry on the Grand Theft Auto tradition playing through the single player campaign as Niko Bellic","Get cars and other modes of transportation anyway you can","Grand Theft Auto IV","Engage in multiplayer challenges ranging from cover matches to shoot-outs","Game Rated 'M' due to Intense Violence, Blood, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Partial Nudity, Use of Drugs and Alcohol"]}

Halo 3 will pick up where Halo 2 left off. The Master Chief is returning to Earth to finish the fight. The Covenant occupation of Earth has uncovered a massive and ancient object beneath the African sands - an object whose secrets have yet to be revealed. Earth's forces are battered and beaten. The Master Chief's AI companion Cortana is still trapped in the clutches of the Gravemind - a horrifying Flood intelligence, and a civil war is raging in the heart of the Covenant. This is how the world ends...","","","The short presentation was delivered in real-time on the Xbox 360 using the current version of the <i>Halo 3</i> game engine. That's right, no studio production video, Bungie and Microsoft delivered the real deal: what they showed at the announcement is what gamers will see when they play Halo 3 in 2007. The HDR lighting, self-shadowing, GPU-run particle system and many other effects are rumored to show up in full effect in the final game. Needless to say, the gaming community is salivating.","CJ Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics discussed one of the most startling moments of the presentation: the return of Cortana. \"Given the variety of character and story arcs at the end of <i>Halo 2</i>, we wanted to boil down our announcement to a few key threads. Cortana and the Chief being a galaxy apart is a situation we haven't seen before, and is something that is a powerful component to <i>Halo 3</i>. We are using her transmissions in the demo to give the viewer a few subtle clues to her situation and state of mind, without revealing any specifics we want to save for the game itself.\"","Graphically, the game closely follows in the tradition of <i>Halo 2</i>, although it has been upgraded to take advantage of the Xbox 360's more prodigious visual abilities. As art direct Marcus Lehto explained, \"[The presentation] was intended to be an understated announcement of <i>Halo 3</i> -- the tone is that of mystery and suspense -- the calm before the storm. I wanted to make sure that we reintroduced the Chief, showed that Earth was thoroughly conquered, with Covenant everywhere, and that there is a glorious, ancient artifact buried under the Earth's crust which will provide <i>Halo 3</i> with the epic journey which we all want.\"","Taking full advantage of the power of Xbox 360, <i>Halo 3</i> expands on everything that has made the franchise great, adding a wealth of technical and gameplay advancements. The game design has evolved with next-generation, high-definition visuals, enhanced A.I., an advanced real-time lighting engine, and, of course, new weapons, characters, and challenges. <i>Halo 3</i> promises an unparalleled first-person shooter experience and, in the end, the most compelling and engrossing story in the franchise's history. Last, but certainly not least, <i>Halo 3</i> builds upon the unique social multiplayer experience and innovative, evolving online gameplay of <i>Halo 2</i>. Rest assured, you'll still be able to run with your clan and battle with (or against) your buddies from coast to coast.",""],"also_buy":["B07B38YC3P","B002BSA20M","B0050SYY5E","B00AOLU3GQ","B001HWB68K","B00FKV8AK6","B00008J7NZ","B0034JKYO6","B0050SYX8W","B002MD02YM","B006HPLKK6","B00005NZ1G","B001MLBJY2","B005YR1VP2","B002I0H79C","B00EVWZHLK","B003ZSP0WW","B000FRS9II","B001AWIP68","B002I098JE","B073WJCQGT","B000FRVAD4","B0002A2S26","B009JLQI5M","B000R0URCE","B0050SYILE","B002I0HBZW","B002BRZ852","B004JSDQPU","B00FATRKOK","B002BSA2LQ","B01DM98L7O","B000ZK9QD2","B007SRM5MO","B003JVKHEQ","B007E5Y8U2","B002GN8HU4","B000P46NMK","B0065NP6NC","B001SH7YMG","B001IK1BJ0","B008B3AVNE","B0001DI6FM","B00EFFW0HC","B003O6E986","B00D9FQAM0","B003O6JKLC","B00MU1YENG","B00BU3ZLJQ","B000X1PE16","B00KAED6RU","B000HCQK0A","B00A7QPNK4","B0009O7HUI","B00503E8S2","B00DB9JV5W","B00KME8KFG","B004IEA4QE","B008K24BKU","B002BSH9JY","B00V84Q1QE","B005DKMC6M","B00D781W3Q","B004PTAG3I","B002BRZ8FW","B000ZK696O","B00K586QQO","B0086V5V9A","B005N4HBE6","B00JPBFC8U","B002I0JGDM","B00008NA6E","B00KSQHX1K","B00YX0Z40Y","B002BSA1MQ","B004HYK956","B00N5FA6WY","B0050SYV70","B07BJKZ7ZS","B0025KZV7A","B01BCMC3CM","B0047TG2R0","B01KBL4ISW","B00ERDGMT4","B0050SY77E","B00A66PAE4","B002I0H2AG","B007F8BLJO","B000TG530M","B001REZLY8","B00NGXUBTI","B01HTRCXBK","B001AZFSDS","B00L9OPNW6","B0742BLW6H","B004QRKWKQ","B00M89T8PO"],"also_view":["B002BSA20M","B0050SYY5E","B00AOLU3GQ","B00361YT9I","B00FKV8AK6","B001HWB68K","B07B38YC3P","B0050SYX8W","B0034JKYO6","B00008J7NZ","B002MD02YM","B006HPLKK6","B00005NZ1G","B000E87WFO","B001MLBJY2","B009JLQI5M","B00KSQHX1K","B002I0H79C","B003IT6E8C","B000FRS9II","B00GV8QTPU","B0017HW5LM","B0002A2S26","B000V761SM","B0010E82ZU","B000ZK9QD2","B002I096Q4","B001AWIP68","B001F6KSDM","B002I0HCVK","B00503E8S2","B004JSDQPU","B0050SYEYK","B01DM98L7O","B000P46NMK","B00EFFW0HC","B0016B28Y8","B0025KZV7A","B00EVWZHLK","B008B3AVNE","B004HYK956","B01NCE21EA","B00DB9JV5W","B002I0J9M0","B0086V5V9A","B002I098JE","B00D781W3Q","B0050SYILE","B00269QLI8","B005YR1VP2","B000FRVAD4","B00MU1YENG","B002I0JGDM","B000TG530M","B00YX0Z40Y","B002BRZ852"],"feature":["Expands on the franchise and adds a wealth of technical and gameplay advancements","Unparalleled first-person shooter experience and the most compelling story of the trilogy","Builds upon the social multiplayer experience and innovative, evolving, online gameplay of Halo 2","Loaded with high-definition visuals, enhanced AI, an advanced lighting engine, new weapons, characters, and challenges"]}

You are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history. Key Features Be an Assassin Master the skills, tactics, and weapons of history's deadliest and most secretive clan of warriors. Plan your attacks, strike without mercy, and fight your way to escape.

As users stand on the Wii Balance Board, included with Wii Fit, their body's overall balance is tied to the game in a way they've never experienced before. Wii Fit also uses the Wii Balance Board for daily tests. These evaluate two key measures that a household can track via progress charts:","The active-play phenomenon started by <i>Wii Sports</i> now spreads to your whole body thanks to <i>Wii Fit</i> and the pressure-sensitive Wii Balance Board, which comes bundled with it. Used together players will experience an extensive array of fun, dynamic and surprisingly challenging activities, including aerobics, yoga, muscle stretches and balance oriented games. The focus of these activities is towards providing a \"core\" workout, a popular exercise method that emphasizes slower, controlled motions, but it's the fun approach to fitness of <i>Wii Fit</i> that will keep players hooked on fitness for years to come.<p/><table width=\"200\" cellpadding=\"15\" align=\"left\"><tr><td align=\"center\"><a name=\"a_plus\"><img alt=\"'Wii Fit' game logo\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_logo.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><br><br><small><center><b><i>Have fun while you get fit</i></b></center></small></td></tr></table><table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_1_lg.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Wii Balance Board\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_1_sm.jpg\" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>The Wii Balance Board.<br/> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_1_lg.jpg\">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_2_lg.jpg\"><img alt=\"Calculate your BMI and Wii Fit age\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_2_sm.jpg\" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>Calculate your BMI and Wii Fit age.<br/> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_2_lg.jpg\">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_3_lg.jpg\"><img alt=\"Enjoy a wide variety of mini-games\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_3_sm.jpg\" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>Enjoy a wide variety of mini-games.<br/> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_3_lg.jpg\">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_4_lg.jpg\"><img alt=\"Follow your own personal trainer\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_4_sm.jpg\" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>Follow your own personal trainer.<br/> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_4_lg.jpg\">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_5_lg.jpg\"><img alt=\"Track your progress against friends\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_5_sm.jpg\" border=0 align=top></a><br><small><center><b><i>Track your progress against friends.<br/> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/wii-fit_5_lg.jpg\">View larger</a>.</i></b></center></small></td></tr></table><b>The <i>Wii Fit</i> Balance Board</b><br/>The primary tenet of <i>Wii Fit</i> is balance. Your center of balance, the point between your left and right sides when you stand upright, has a lot to do with your health. Those without an even center of balance will be unnaturally compensating for this imbalance, which causes their posture to become misaligned, increasing the possibility of putting unnecessary strain on their bodies. This is where the Wii Balance Board comes in.<p/>Similar in appearance to a step aerobics board, the Wii Balance Board is much, much more. Easily capable of supporting weights up to a maximum of 300 pounds, it is sturdy and precise, able to measure weight and register pressure accurately when placed on a variety of flat surfaces. This advanced level of sensitivity allows for both the wide range of activities found in the <i>Wii Fit</i> software as well as the board's amazing ability recognize individual players by their weight alone.<p/><b>Getting Started: Create a Profile</b><br/>Before you jump into doing exercises and activities, you&#146;ll start by creating a profile. This is done easily and intuitively by simply choosing a Mii, entering your height and age information, and doing a few quick tests that will serve as a baseline for your new Wii fitness regimen. These tests are:<ul><li><u>BMI Check</u>: BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that is the standard used by agencies such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health. To check your BMI, you&#146;ll enter your height then stand on the Wii Balance Board and let it read your weight.<li><u>Wii Fit Age</u>: After you&#146;ve checked your BMI, you&#146;ll do a basic balance test and find out your current <i>Wii Fit</i> Age. This basic balance test measures how well you can control your left and right balance. Based on the results, you&#146;ll be assigned a Wii Fit Age.</ul><p/><b>Four Categories of Fun</b><br/>Once you have created your profile it's time to have some fun. <i>Wii Fit</i> features four main categories of exercises to choose from: Strength Training, Aerobics, Yoga and Balance Games. <i>Wii Fit</i> will guide you through the first three with the help of your own virtual personal trainer, while the balance games offer variety and fun to help keep you engaged and excited about your fitness goals. In addition, as you spend time exercising, you&#146;ll earn <i>Fit</i> Credits that unlock additional exercises and activities within your favorite categories that will allow you to continue to push yourself. See more detail on the four categories below: <ul><li><u>Strength Training</u>: Put your strength to the test with muscle-toning exercises like Single Leg Extension, Sideways Leg Lift, Arm and Leg Lift, Single-Arm Stand, Torso Twists, Rowing Squat, Single Leg Twist, Lunge, Push-Up and Side Plank, Jackknife, Plank and Tricep Extension. Challenges include Push-Up Challenge, Plank Challenge and Jackknife Challenge.<li><u>Aerobics</u>: Get your heart pumping with fun, interactive Aerobic exercises like Hula Hoop, Basic Step, Basic Run, Super Hula Hoop, Advanced Step, 2-P Run, Rhythm Boxing, Free Step and Free Run.<li><u>Yoga</u>: Work on your balance and flexibility with Yoga poses and activities like Deep Breathing, Half-Moon, Dance, Cobra, Bridge, Spinal Twist, Shoulder Stand, Warrior, Tree, Sun Salutation, Standing Knee, Palm Tree, Chair, Triangle and Downward-Facing Dog.<li><u>Balance Games</u>: Get into the action with fun, balanced-based games like Soccer Heading, Ski Slalom, Ski Jump, Table Tilt, Tightrope Walk, Balance Bubble, Penguin Slide, Snowboard Slalom and Lotus Focus.</ul><p/><b>Keep Track of Your Progress</b><br/>Because keeping fit is an ongoing process, <i>Wii Fit</i> also tracks the activities you do the most and puts them into your Favorites category. With this information players can note exercises and activities that they are strong in, as well as others that may need to improve at. Some of the ways players can use this information for are to: <ul><li>Keep tabs on your daily progress with easy-to-understand graphs and charts. Using your personal profile, you can set goals, view a graph of your BMI results over time, see how many Fit Credits you&#146;ve earned, check your <i>Wii Fit</i> Age and even enter exercise time you&#146;ve done outside of <i>Wii Fit</i>. It&#146;s all about coming back and exercising a little every day, and the personal profile makes tracking your daily progress simple and easy.<li>Quickly check your <i>Wii Fit Age</i> and BMI without even putting the game in the console by going directly to the <i>Wii Fit</i> Channel.<li>Allow up to eight family members can create their own profiles in <i>Wii Fit</i>. On the profile-selection screen, everyone in the family can see each other&#146;s recent BMI progress and Fit Credit total. This will allow families to have a friendly competition to exercise and get fit.</ul>Variety, fun and progress tracking; <i>Wii Fit</i> has it all. So, Wii owners if you ready to reclaim your balance and get fit all you need is <i>Wii Fit</i>, a few minutes a day to play and the urge to have fun. Get on board today."],"also_buy":["B002BS47JE","B07G7G55W4","B001KX504C","B0017Q4DGI","B0009VXBAQ","B0013E9HP6","B002BUSVJO","B002CSLY1W","B0015RTB70","B003OZZJGS","B0024MNOGE","B07BZS1566","B009M72E5Q","B001H0RZX2","B004W1IX1G","B003EGULF6","B0045F8QD4","B004WLRR4K","B07DZDJ739","B003LDKIQ4","B00AFYAUYW","B003JZASVE","B003TK1HSM","B0015HZLUQ","B008BERGYU","B001CCMEUY","B009AGXH64","B002BSA3EM","B00ENEG73S","B003OQ4B1Q","B007UNC2GA","B001COQW14","B000R3BNE2","B00S6XMJKC","B0018RWMRS","B00634MLMW","B003DSAT0C","B002ECN43C","B001GIUWX0","B004IK24MU","B013B244WS","B000IMWK2G","B003O6FV8S","B074W7471Q","B004BY4HN2","B001PO2BJI","B06XD2PGKW","B01N8XA4YI","B01E5BV2OW","B002K9VIAU","B00GRQAMJA","B00434FED2","B002BRZ9G0","B003O6C0V4","B002GEKIOG","B001KWE2WE","B002KJ9XE8","B0015RPDAY","B005IGPY48","B0019R4VD0","B00FE8WKMO","B01M0UDCN5","B0053BG26C","B01C41IIBU","B0186G8X1C","B0031QFJVU","B00N4OAELY","B001FEO74U","B00KTNSKZU","B003YLWJLA","B004WLRQCI","B01IO5A534","B0094X227I","B06XKV35B9","B00FE8WKPQ","B015EPCECW","B07539JW4W"],"also_view":["B0024MNOGE","B002BSA3EM","B002CSLY1W","B002BS47JE","B0186G8X1C","B00FE8WKPQ","B018UR34KM","B015EPCECW","B0732JXZ16","B00B8QDNN6","B07FK9Q81N","B01MR12K6Z","B001H0RZX2","B001KX504C","B00S6XMJKC","B00FE8WKMO","B00P5DOOTU","B07HPDYRG7","B004USOTTG","B001CCMEUY","B07CT67SSF","B0009VXBAQ","B003OZZJGS","B003TK1HSM","B0017Q4DGI","B006FHQBZK","B0045F8QD4","B004W1IX1G","B007WM88KI","B003PGUTLG","B0015RTB70","B004WLRR4K","B003O6C0V4","B0013E9HP6","B002U2C2QG","B0015HZLUQ","B003LDKIQ4","B0086V5TYC","B07G7G55W4","B008BERGYU","B07BZS1566","B001COQW14","B003GEDLYO","B00GRFZRP0","B01J4JSP0O","B002KJ9XE8","B0037AIJVW","B0056C2LIG","B001MBUGLY","B00AFYAUYW","B009M72E5Q","B002CZ7P04","B00509TLP6","B001KWE2WE","B003G2UUHW","B004ZI8S70"],"feature":["Wii Fit requires a Wii console to play.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate in <i>Borderlands</i>. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> As in a traditional RPG, <i>Borderlands</i> is built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests. These quests include both story-driven adventures and side quests that offer players rewards such as items exclusive to quest completion and/or forward movement of the story. Players can look forward to action set in both single player and multiplayer modes--including co-op play--as well as vehicular combat, literally thousands of different types of weapons that change each time you play and randomly generated maps and map features. <p/> <b>Playable Characters</b><br/> <i>Borderlands</i> features several playable characters, each with its own unique backstory, abilities and skills. Skills can be leveled up, allowing for improvement of things like health, accuracy with weapons and capacity for items. In addition to this, characters possess unique skill tree development, ensuring that each will develop differently regardless of time spend leveling them up. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Co-op Design</b> - <i>Borderlands</i> is built from the ground up to be an exciting, intuitive co-operative experience for up to four players simultaneously that rewards players who work together and invest in co-op skills.

Chris Redfield, returning Resident Evil hero, has followed the path of the evil literally around the globe. After joining a new organization, Chris heads to Africa where the latest bioterrorism threat is literally transforming the people and animals of the city into mindless, maddened creatures. He is joined by a new partner, Sheva Alomar, who lends her strength, intelligence and sharp-shooting skills to the mission. In order to survive, Chris and Sheva must work together to take on the challenges of discovering the truth behind this evil plot. Utilizing a revolutionary new co-op mode of gameplay, players will be able to assume control of either Chris or Sheva and experience Resident Evil in new ways. In Resident Evil 5, Capcom will have players fearing the daylight as much as they have feared shadow in previous games. Promising to revolutionize the series by delivering an unbelievable level of detail, realism and control, Resident Evil 5 is certain to bring new fans to the series. New technology developed specifically for the game, as well as incredible changes to both the gameplay and world of Resident Evil will make this a must-have game for gamers across the globe.","Experience the thrill and terror all over again with <i>Resident Evil 5</i> for Xbox 360. Featuring Chris Redfield of the original <i>Resident Evil</i> and Sheva Alomar, a West African agent of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), this sci-fi survival game is staged in a remote desert colony packed with hordes of fast-moving, quick-thinking enemies that represent a whole new breed of evil.","<style type=\"text/css\"> .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: 20px; } table.callout { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, serif; margin: 10px; width: 250; } td.callout { height: 100 percent; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding: 10px; width: 250px; } ul.callout { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -12px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5em; } h5.callout { text-align: center; } img.withlink {border:1px black solid;} a.nodecoration {text-decoration: none} </style>","You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguished <i>Resident Evil 4</i>, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.","<b>Learn to Work Together</b><br /> The new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.","<b>Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of Kijuju</b><br /> An advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.","<b>Face the Next Generation of Evil</b><br /> You'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep even <i>Resident Evil</i> masters on their toes.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same. <p/> An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Built around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action in <i>infamous</i> contains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources. <p/> This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players in <i>infamous</i> <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b>: <ul> <li><b>Be a Hero</b> - Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.</li> <li><b>Super Powers</b> - Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.</li> <li><b>Epic Battles</b> - Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.</li> <li><b>Open Dynamic World</b> - Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

New visual effects include ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, improved character lighting, the ability to render hundreds of on-screen characters simultaneously, improved water physics, additional blood and bullet decals, advanced destructible environments, new weather effects, and the introduction of fluid objects.","<b>Immersive, Gripping Story</b><br> Taking place six months after the end of the first game, <i>Gears of War 2</i> returns the cast of characters of the original, including Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago, as well as several newcomers.","Novelist and comic book writer Joshua Ortega, who assisted with the writing, has created a story that is big on character development and personality. With a new in-game conversational camera system and multiple story arcs, the story is presented in a gripping cinematic style where characters gain an emotional depth that matches their realistic graphical representation.","<b>More Characters, Upgraded Vehicles, Badder Weapons</b><br> Those who were impressed by the original <i>Gears of War</i> will be in for a real treat. New characters such as Tai Kaliso, weapons like the burst pistol, and huge vehicles like the COG Centaur tank will give players a whole new dimension and scope of gameplay in both single-player and multi-player modes.","<br clear=\"all\"> <center> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZK9QD2-5-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=446,height=620'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZK9QD2-5-sm.jpg\" border=0></a> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZK9QD2-6-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=620,height=402'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZK9QD2-6-sm.jpg\" border=0></a> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZK9QD2-7-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=620,height=398'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZK9QD2-7-sm.jpg\" border=0></a> </center> <br clear=\"all\"> <b>Multiplayer Action with Xbox LIVE!</b><br> <i>Gears of War 2</i> features a multiplayer mode that allows up to 10 simultaneous players for outstanding multiplayer fun.

StarCraft II will once again center on the clash between the protoss, terrans, and zerg, with each side deploying favorite units from the original StarCraft, along with numerous upgraded and brand-new units and abilities that allow for fresh tactics and strategies. The game's new 3D-graphics engine maintains the speed and responsive control of its predecessor while rendering hundreds of units onscreen for massive battles. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty's solo campaign will continue the epic saga where it left off in StarCraft: Brood War. The storyline chronicles the exploits of marshal-turned-rebel-leader Jim Raynor and features both familiar faces and new heroes. Players will be able to tailor the experience, choosing their own mission path and selecting technology and research upgrades to suit their playing style throughout the 29-mission campaign. Several challenge-mode mini-games will also be included, with focused goals designed to ease players into the basics of multiplayer strategies. In addition, dozens of multiplayer maps will be available for competitive play through the new version of Battle.net, which is launching alongside StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. This new version of the service has been built from the ground up to offer an unparalleled online play experience, with new features such as voice communication, character profiles and achievements, stat-tracking, ladders and leagues, cloud file storage, and more.","<br /> <div class=\"productDescriptionWrapper\"><br /> <img align=\"left\" alt=\"logo-200\" height=\"70\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B000ZKA0J6-logo-200.jpg\" width=\"200\" /><br /> In the distant future, in the darkest regions of space, the ghosts of the past whisper your name.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.","<b>The Return of the Chimera</b><br> The Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.","Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.","<b>The Battle Moves to the United States</b><br> After the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.","In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.","<b>Online game play Goes BIG</b><br> Powered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.","<br clear=\"all\"> <center> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EVNV5K-5-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=500,height=290'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EVNV5K-5-sm.jpg\" border=0></a> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EVNV5K-6-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=500,height=290'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EVNV5K-6-sm.jpg\" border=0></a> <a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EVNV5K-7-lg.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,null,'width=500,height=290'); return false;\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B001EVNV5K-7-sm.jpg\" border=0></a><br><br> <span class=\"caption\">Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.</class> </center> <br clear=\"all\">"],"also_buy":["B003O6E67A","B000JLIXIG","B008PQU3E4","B000FQBF1M","B0050SWUTQ","B000ZK7ZOE","B002I0K6DG","B00354NANC","B002I0GX88","B002BRZ6UE","B003O6EDSM","B0050SXVK8","B008CP6MA2","B0044SA734","B00309XHD0","B00CTKHXFO","B008CP6Q6M","B0022TNO7I","B002AB7TX8","B000FQ2D5E","B007CM0K86","B000X1TC0U","B0055202HE","B004J6I0YO","B0050SWZHS","B0050SXGU8","B000WS97QI","B005N4HBIW","B005VBVQDI","B008XMSR6G","B006JKAS16","B00320JAWY","B002I0J5JW","B000K9OP2A","B00275A7LI","B0050SX7BQ","B007A7UJ4S","B0050SXI6K","B000P46NMA","B002I0H2G0","B002BRYIJY","B008E6ZXTA","B0085CA8QG","B008CP6RUW","B00CPKUV98","B001CRM3YQ","B00BGA9V2Q","B003C1I06U","B003O6KWZK","B003O6CBIG","B003O680RM","B00JKM06EO","B000FQ9IDE","B00C7103DO","B0050SXAIG","B002NN7AKU","B002BXKJ6O","B000QAVV6G","B0045U01OG","B00NGXUBR0","B007UM599S","B000HKMPVA","B0016C3260","B003O6HLOK","B005YR308S","B00KTZELMY","B000HKP88C","B000SQ5LQE","B0086V5V8G","B0037LVW9M","B009DL2TBA","B004EQCCI4","B00163LW7K","B0065NP05G","B001UWGCW2","B00020LZAW","B00946FSIA","B002I0J45C","B07D3MFTHL","B003JVCA9Q","B004NRN5EO","B004HCYVO8","B003R7H5TC","B004P7VGF2","B000FNA30Y","B000P297EI","B00DV16N6U","B01DM98VJC","B008CP6RWU","B001AWBYNE","B000HWX418","B002I0K1Y0","B004ML44Y6","B001SGZL2W","B0041OWQTO","B003GT8IL0","B002ELCV00","B004UDB9SA","B002BRYHY0","B0050SXLQC"],"also_view":["B003O6E67A","B000JLIXIG","B008PQU3E4","B00354NANC","B009JBFF9C","B002I0K6DG","B000FQBF1M","B008CP6Q6M","B0050SXI6K","B00E9C2BXE","B007CM0K86","B00CPKUV98","B001FB56NY","B002I0GX88","B0050SXWKW","B000ZK7ZOE","B002BXKJ6O","B004J6I0YO","B0050SXGU8","B000X1TC0U","B0050JN8E6","B0050SXAIG","B003O6CBIG","B008CP6MA2","B002AB7TX8","B002BRZ6UE","B0050SWUTQ","B0050SWZHS","B0045U01OG","B0050SXVK8","B000FQ2D5E","B0044SA734","B00CTKHXFO","B003O6HLOK","B005N4HBIW","B0050SXKU4","B00DJ42BUQ","B000FNA30Y","B00CORLGW8","B003O6EDSM","B0055202HE","B000K9OP2A","B002I0J6DC","B004HYK8Y8","B005VBVQDI","B00CJ7IUI6","B00309XHD0","B0166QDR9W","B0050SX3KG","B001TOMQOY","B002I0J5FG","B003O6KWZK","B002I0J8FI","B002ELCV00","B000ZK9QCS","B0050SX9VO","B000JLIYLC","B006JKAS16"],"feature":["Resistance 2 for the PlayStation 3 is an alternate-history, first-person shooter that puts you in the heroic role of Sgt.

Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster &#151; somehow familiar, yet still quite different from anything ever seen &#151; has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city. It is a Big Sister, new denizens of Rapture who were once one of the forgotten little girls known as Little Sisters, known to inhabit the city's dank halls. No longer a pawn used to harvest ADAM, the dangerously powerful gene-altering lifeblood of Rapture, from the bodies of others and in turn run the risk of being harvested herself, the Big Sister is now the fastest and most powerful thing in Rapture. You, on the other hand are the very first Big Daddy, in fact the prototype, that for some reason has reactivated. You are similar to the Big Daddies familiar from the original <i>BioShock</i>, but also very different in that you possess free will and no memory of the events of the past ten years. The question is, as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city beneath the waves, hunting for answers and the solution to your own survival, are you really the hunter, or the hunted? <p/> <b>Gameplay and Multiplayer</b><br/> In <i>BioShock 2</i> players will take on the role of the original Big Daddy, not that of game one protagonist, Jack. As a Big Daddy you will have access to all the strengths and weapons of a standard Big Daddy, including the drill and rivet gun. More importantly you also possess free will and the ability to use plasmids and gene tonics &#151; genetic modifications allowed for through ADAM, a stem cell harvested from conquered enemies, or sea slugs outside the Rapture air lock, and powered by the in-game injectable serum known as EVE, which can be found, captured or purchased. Plasmids and gene tonics provide a wide range of aggressive and passive abilities which can be upgraded and arranged for quick use. The ability to use plasmids and tonics gives you a decided edge over other Big Daddies and most other denizens of Rapture, excluding the powerful Big Sisters. In addition, due to their role as a Big Daddy, players will experience a new relation to the Little Sisters. Upon defeating standard Big Daddys you are given the familiar choice as to whether to harvest or adopt them. Harvesting gains you ADAM immediately, but could alter your path through the game, while adopting makes you responsible for Little Sisters, who then accompany you through Rapture, but also provide aid and warning in times of danger. Additional gameplay features include: new plasmids, weapons and the ability to combine these two. <p/> The game also features the anticipated multiplayer modes. Several of these are team-based, allowing up to 10 players.

Only              the third major release in what is considered by many gamers as the              most iconic RPG franchise of all time, <em>Diablo 3</em> continues the              land of Sanctuary's battle against a reoccurring demonic evil, and              provides players around the world with the opportunity to create the              ultimate hero to quest against it with friends online, or on their              own.

Yet for those who battled the Prime Evils, the memory fades slowly. When Deckard Cain returns to the ruins of Tristram Cathedral seeking clues to defeat new stirrings of evil, a fiery harbinger of doom falls from the heavens, striking the very ground where Diablo once entered the world.

In Raiden's case it was a victory over Shao Kahn, while Superman bested Darkseid. These occurred at the exact same time and involved inter-dimensional elements, which somehow merged their two enemies into one being, Dark Kahn, while allowing the characters of the two universes to interact. In this merging the powers of the heroes and villains are scrambled as well, making some stronger than they ever were, and leaving others vulnerable for the first time in their lives, allowing each to battle on more or less equal footing. And battle they do without realizing that the uncontrollable rage that they feel for each other is actually the work of Dark Khan. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> <i>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</i> being a fighter, gameplay consists of one-on-one battles, both in local play and online, in which players can choose a character from either side who will face off against a counterpart from the other. Each character has unique attacks and special finishing moves, and fighting arenas vary depending on whether your character comes from the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> or DC universe. Keeping with the reputation for brutality in the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> franchise, characters from this side will have access to fatalities, while the historically less overly violent DC characters will execute \"heroic brutalities,\" which are end moves where the opponent while beaten, is not killed. The game also features new gameplay mechanics such as: Freefall Kombat, in which players can engage in extended combat while in midair; Klose Kombat, during which the play angle moves to a close-up view of the action; The Test Your Might mini-game where you smash your opponent through walls; and Rage Mode, which increases the power of a character's attack by 50% and provides protection against being stunned by an opponent. <p/> <b>Playable Characters</b><br/> Playable characters in <i>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</i> consist of some of the most popular heroes and villains from both universes, with most being available from the beginning of the game and some unlockable throughout. They include the following: <p/> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <tr> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td> <div align=\"center\"><b>Mortal Kombat</b></div> </td> <td> <div align=\"center\"><b>DC Universe</b></div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td height=\"233\"> <ul> <li>Baraka</li> <li>Jax</li> <li>Kano</li> <li>Kitana</li> <li>Liu Kang</li> <li>Raiden</li> <li>Scorpion</li> <li>Shang Tsung</li> <li>Shao Kahn</li> <li>Sonya Blade</li> <li>Subzero</li> <li>Dark Khan</li> </ul> </td> <td height=\"233\"> <ul> <li>Batman</li> <li>Captain Marvel</li> <li>Catwoman</li> <li>Darkseid</li> <li>Deathstroke</li> <li>The Flash</li> <li>Green Lantern</li> <li>The Joker</li> <li>Lex Luthor</li> <li>Superman</li> <li>Wonder Woman</li> <li>Dark Khan</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </table> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><b>Choose Your Kombatant</b> - Kombat forces friends to fight, worlds to collide, and unlikely alliances to be forged.

Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, fortune hunter Nathan Drake soon realizes Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret - he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, the \"Wish-fulfilling jewel\" of Buddhist mythology. With this new information Drake settles on a new course, following Marco Polo's trail through a diverse range of exotic environments. This quest also pits him against a new, more formidable adversary - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and a relentless ambition to recover the stone for himself. <p/> <b>Gameplay</b><br/> Although gameplay in <i>Among Thieves</i> is similar to that of the previous game, there are several major differences. The most important of these is the addition of several online multiplayer options. Unfortunately, no offline multiplayer could be included in the game due to the impact local split-screening has on the game's graphical quality. Thankfully though, the online modes included cover both co-op and competitive play. See the feature list below for details on these. In addition to play modes players can also expect a wealth of new gameplay features including a new stealth gameplay mechanic and altered climbing mechanic--both of which are extended to the AI of enemies; the ability to create cover by flipping over certain found items; the use of riot shields for defense and offense; and a complete lack of loading screens. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li>Powered by Naughty Dog&rsquo;s new 2.0 Engine Technology.</li> <li>Open layout allows players to take an aggressive or stealth approach to combat.</li> <li>Free-flowing \"traversal gunplay\" adds a unique vertical element to standard 3rd-person shooting mechanics.</li> <li>Award-winning cinematic story presentation.</li> <li>A Deep Single Player Campaign <ul> <li>An expanded cast of characters who reflect different facets of Drake&rsquo;s character, including Chloe Frazer, Drake&rsquo;s current partner and new romantic interest.</li> <li>Varied and exotic locations &ndash; from lush, green swamps and dense urban environments, all the way to the ice and snow of the Himalayas.</li> <li>Unrestricted combat allows you to take an aggressive or stealthy approach to combat.</li> <ul> <li>Free-flowing \"traversal gunplay\" adds a unique vertical element to familiar cover-based third-person shooting mechanics, allowing you to engage in combat from any position in the environment &ndash; even while climbing and hanging.</li> <li>Introduction of new traversal and free-climbing mechanics allow Drake to navigate through the environments more fluidly and naturally.</li> <li>Gunplay and combat enhancements, including an expanded melee system, and a variety of enemy types with advanced AI routines.

Wii</i>, like all the previous releases in the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip down <i>Mario Bros.</i> memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote, <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> manages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer. <p/> <b>A Franchise First: Simultaneous Multiplayer</b><br/> Since the very first <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. In <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> players can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> fun. <p/> <b>Controller Choices Via the Wii Remote</b><br/> In another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used with <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> is held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which is <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i>. <p/> <b>Key Game Features</b> <ul> <li><i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> offers a combination of cooperation and competition.

It is capable of mouse movements of up to 200 inches per second and 50 g acceleration, meaning you can move it at either fast or slow speeds, and it will always respond onscreen with exacting accuracy and the organic fluidity only possible with optical sensor. The Razer DeathAdders sensor is also capable of tracking Z-axis to as low as 1 mm on most surfaces including glass table tops.

We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out whats happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And its not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.","In <em>Watch_Dogs</em>, this system is called the Central Operating System (ctOS) and it controls almost every piece of the citys technology and holds key information on all of the citys residents.","You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the citys network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy, and more.","Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.","Control the citys infrastructure, in real time, with Aiden's cell phone. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the citys ctOS can become your weapon.","Discover a new level of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.","Go beyond the console with a ground-breaking, real-time, companion game. This innovative mobile platform allows players to connect and compete with friends, even when away from the home console. The <em>Watch_Dogs</em> companion game delivers revolutionary dual-screen gameplay that enables you to play from anywhere, at any time.","Create your own way to attack. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or use combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in a situation. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 weapons that rival any shooter.","Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles bursting with horsepower to explore the massive city while completing missions. Ubisoft Montreal partnered with Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to develop each vehicle with state-of-art physics and handling.","Experience the advanced processing and graphics capabilities of Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to <em>Watch_Dogs</em>.

Call of Duty(R): Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty(R) franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America's borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as \"Ghosts\" leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty(R) before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty(R) game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer.
